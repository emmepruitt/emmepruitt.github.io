freshman record for threes. Alexis Markowski shot 10 percent better from three than every other forward and center in the Big Ten Conference. Impressive to say the least.\nShooting 50 percent from behind the arc as a guard is incredible. The average from three is 33.3 percent. Shooting 50 percent as a center is incredible.\nTo answer my own question: There is no doubt that Alexis Markowski was the best in the 2021-2022 season.\nLeading her team in rebounds, leading the league in three point percentage, and dominating against house hold names, Markowski was voted Big Ten Freshman of the year, and recieved eight Big Ten Freshman of the Week awards.\nThis year, the stakes are high for Alexis. The reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year is on the pursuit for Big Ten Player of the year, and even Naismith Player of the Year.\nThe scariest part for the Big Ten and anyone in Alexis Markowski’s way is that she has three. seasons. left."
