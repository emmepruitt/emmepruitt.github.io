freshman record for threes. Alexis Markowski shot 10 percent better from three than every other forward and center in the Big Ten Conference. Impressive to say the least.\nShooting 50 percent from behind the arc as a guard is incredible. The average from three is 33.3 percent. Shooting 50 percent as a center is incredible.\nTo answer my own question: There is no doubt that Alexis Markowski was the best in the 2021-2022 season.\nLeading her team in rebounds, leading the league in three point percentage, and dominating against house hold names, Markowski was voted Big Ten Freshman of the year, and recieved eight Big Ten Freshman of the Week awards.\nThis year, the stakes are high for Alexis. The reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year is on the pursuit for Big Ten Player of the year, and even Naismith Player of the Year.\nThe scariest part for the Big Ten and anyone in Alexis Markowski’s way is that she has three. seasons. left."

The second most offensive rebounds in Coach William’s time here is 404, in the years 2018-2019.\nBy looking at all of the data presented here, it is pretty clear to see that the 2021-2022 Husker squad is the best one that Amy Williams has had in her six years at Nebraska. Almost at the top of the conference in some cases (despite the FG percentage.)\nThe women’s team has been off to a bit shaky start this year, but only time will tell how the 2021-2022 season data compares to the 2022-2023 data. There is still a lot of basketball left to play.\nBut as of this moment, last years squad was the best Amy has had in a while."
